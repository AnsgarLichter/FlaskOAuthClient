# FlaskOAuthClient

This repository contains a proof of concept for an OAuth 2.0 client in Python with Flask.
This PoC is needed for an university project.
If you want to test the client with your own OAuth server, have a look at the [OAuth Server PoC](https://github.com/AnsgarLichter/FlaskOAuthServer).

## Authlib
This PoC uses [Authlib](https://authlib.org/) as a library to make the implementation easier. Authlib is used because the university 
project has already used Authlib for other scenarios.
